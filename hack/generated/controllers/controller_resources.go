// KnownTypes defines an array of runtime.Objects to be reconciled, where each
// object in the array will generate a controller. If the concrete type
// implements the owner interface, the generated controllers will inject the
// owned types supplied by the Owns() method of the CRD type. Each controllers
// may directly reconcile a single object, but may indirectly watch
// and reconcile many Owned objects. The singular type is necessary to generically
// produce a reconcile function aware of concrete types, as a closure.
