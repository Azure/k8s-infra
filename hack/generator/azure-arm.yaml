typeFilters:
  - action: prune
    group: definitions
    name: Expression
    because: expression is an ARM template construct which doesn't belong in CRDs
  - action: include
    version: 2020-*
    because: all 2020 API versions are included
  - action: prune
    version: '*preview'
    because: preview SDK versions are excluded by default
exportFilters:
  - action: exclude
    group: deploymenttemplate
    because: this is the "container" group that holds references to all of the other groups and as such doesn't make sense to generate
  - action: exclude
    group: definitions
    name: NumberOrExpression
    because: this type is not really used, it's just float64. We remap this type to float64 in typetransformers so we can skip exporting it too
  - action: exclude
    group: definitions
    name: ResourceBase
    because: this type is not used
typeTransformers:
  - group: definitions
    name: NumberOrExpression
    because: NumberOrExpression is an ARM template artifact that doesn't make sense in CRDs
